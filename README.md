Python library for efficient multi-threaded data processing, with the support for out-of-memory datasets.

If you are an R user, chances are that you have already been using the [data.table](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/data.table/data.table.pdf) package. Data.table is an extension of the data.frame package in R. It's also the go-to package for R users when it comes to the fast aggregation of large data (including 100GB in RAM).

The R's data.table package is a very versatile and a high-performance package due to its ease of use, convenience and programming speed. It is a fairly famous package in the R community with over 400k downloads per month and almost 650 CRAN and Bioconductor packages using it([source](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/wiki)).

So, what is in it for the Python users? Well, the good news is that there also exists a Python counterpart to thedata.table package called datatable which has a clear focus on big data support, high performance, both in-memory and out-of-memory datasets, and multi-threaded algorithms. In a way, it can be called as data.table's younger sibling.


## Installation

On MacOS systems installing datatable is as easy as
```sh
pip install datatable
```

On Linux you can install a binary distribution as
```sh
# If you have Python 3.5
pip install https://s3.amazonaws.com/h2o-release/datatable/stable/datatable-0.8.0/datatable-0.8.0-cp35-cp35m-linux_x86_64.whl

# If you have Python 3.6
pip install https://s3.amazonaws.com/h2o-release/datatable/stable/datatable-0.8.0/datatable-0.8.0-cp36-cp36m-linux_x86_64.whl
```

On all other platforms a source distribution will be needed. For more
information see [Build instructions](https://datatable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html).
